# Prodigy Infotech Machine Learning Internship

This repository consists of the tasks which I have completed given during **Machine Learning internship** at **Prodigy Infotech** 

# TASKS

## Task 1 - House Price Prediction

To implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Dataset : - https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
